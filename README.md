# Chipyard for CPRE581!

This is a forked version of Chipyard for working on the BOOM core for CPRE581 final project.

### How to use?
1. Clone this repo.
2. Build it following [Chipyard's docs](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html)
3. You need to source the start-up script everytime: `source env.sh`
4. Build BOOM for Verilator (the simulator):  
    1. cd into sims/verilator: `cd sims/verilator`
    2. Run: `make CONFIG=MediumBoomV4Config` (There are other BOOM configs, checkout `<chipyard root>/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/config/BoomConfigs.scala` for the list)
    3. BOOM! You now have BOOM for simulation! Now you can:  
        1. Run one of the riscv-tools assembly tests: `./simulator-chipyard.harness-MediumBoomV4Config $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-p-simple`
        2. Run simulations, see the [Chipyard Docs](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Simulation/Software-RTL-Simulation.html#sw-rtl-sim-intro) for more details.

Below are the list of commands for easy access:  
| Command | Run where | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Building a core |
| `make CONFIG=MediumBoomV4Config` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to build BOOM for Verilator |
| `make CONFIG=GemminiRocketConfig` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to build Gemmini for Rocket |
| `make CONFIG=RocketGemminiFor581Config` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to build Rocket+Gemmini for 581 |
| Running simulations |
| `./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketGemminiFor581Config $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/benchmarks/vvadd.riscv` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to run the vvadd.riscv benchmark |
| `./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketGemminiFor581Config ~/chipyard/tests/hello.riscv` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to run the hello.c test program |
| `./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketGemminiFor581Config ../../generators/gemmini/software/gemmini-rocc-tests/build/bareMetalC/MaMA_matmul_ws-baremetal` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | Run MaMA benchmark for matmul ws. |
| `./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketGemminiFor581Config $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/benchmarks/vvadd.riscv` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to run the vvadd.riscv benchmark |
| `./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketGemminiFor581Config ~/chipyard/tests/hello.riscv` | `<chipyard>/sims/verilator` | This is to run the hello.c test program |
| `spike <a riscv exe>` | anywhere | Simulate a RISC-V program. |
| `spike ~/chipyard/generators/gemmini/software/gemmini-rocc-tests/build/bareMetalC/MaMA_matmul_cpu-baremetal` | anywhere | Simulate our matmul cpu program. |

### How is this repo built?
> Below are summary of instructions from [Chipyard docs](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html)
1. Make sure you set up the conda correctly as per [this guide](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html#default-requirements-installation).  
    - Tips: If you get an error at step 9, run this `sudo apt-get install libguestfs-tools`
2. Clone repo (either the [official chipyard repo](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard), or this repo works)
3. `./build-setup.sh riscv-tools` (takes time), if it fails at somewhat random spots, try rerunning the same command.
4. Done! You should be able to `source env.sh` and start doing stuff!

## Using Chipyard

To get started using Chipyard, see the documentation on the Chipyard documentation site: https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/

## What is Chipyard

Chipyard is an open source framework for agile development of Chisel-based systems-on-chip.
It will allow you to leverage the Chisel HDL, Rocket Chip SoC generator, and other [Berkeley][berkeley] projects to produce a [RISC-V][riscv] SoC with everything from MMIO-mapped peripherals to custom accelerators.
Chipyard contains processor cores ([Rocket][rocket-chip], [BOOM][boom], [CVA6 (Ariane)][cva6]), vector units ([Saturn](saturn), [Ara](ara)), accelerators ([Gemmini][gemmini], [NVDLA][nvdla]), memory systems, and additional peripherals and tooling to help create a full featured SoC.
Chipyard supports multiple concurrent flows of agile hardware development, including software RTL simulation, FPGA-accelerated simulation ([FireSim][firesim]), automated VLSI flows ([Hammer][hammer]), and software workload generation for bare-metal and Linux-based systems ([FireMarshal][firemarshal]).
Chipyard is actively developed in the [Berkeley Architecture Research Group][ucb-bar] in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department][eecs] at the [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley].
